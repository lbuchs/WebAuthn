# WebAuthn
*A simple PHP WebAuthn (FIDO2) server library*

The goal of this project is to provide a small, lightweight, understandable library to protect logins with passkeys, security keys like Yubico or Solo, fingerprint on Android, or Windows Hello.

## Manual
See /_test for a simple usage of this library. Check [webauthn.lubu.ch](https://webauthn.lubu.ch) for a working example.

### Supported attestation statement formats
* android-key &#x2705;
* android-safetynet &#x2705;
* apple &#x2705;
* fido-u2f &#x2705;
* none &#x2705;
* packed &#x2705;
* tpm &#x2705;

> [!NOTE]
> This library supports authenticators that are signed with an X.509 certificate or that are self-attested. ECDAA is not supported.

## Workflow

             JAVASCRIPT            |          SERVER
    ------------------------------------------------------------
                             REGISTRATION

            |
            '------------------------->     processCreate

            |
            '------------------------->      processGet

## Attestation
Typically, when someone logs in, you only need to confirm that they are using the same device they used during
registration. In this scenario, you do not require any form of attestation.
However, if you need additional security, such as when your company mandates the use of a Solokey for login,
you can verify its authenticity through direct attestation. Companies may also purchase authenticators that
are signed with their own root certificate, enabling them to validate that an authenticator is affiliated with
their organization.

### no attestation
Just verify that the device is the same device used on registration.
You can use 'none' attestation with this library if you only check 'none' as format.

> [!TIP]
> This is probably what you want to use if you want secure login for a public website.

### Indirect attestation
The browser may replace the AAGUID and attestation statement with a more privacy-friendly and/or more easily
verifiable version of the same data (for example, by employing an anonymization CA).
You cannot validate against any root CA if the browser uses an anonymization certificate.
This library sets attestation to indirect if you select multiple formats but don't provide any root CA.

> [!TIP]
> A hybrid solution. Clients may be discouraged by browser warnings, but then you know what device they're using (statistics rulez!).

### Direct attestation
The browser provides data about the identificator device, which can be identified uniquely.
Users could be tracked across multiple sites. Because of this, the browser may show a warning message about providing this data during registration.
This library sets attestation to direct if you select multiple formats and provide root CAs.

> [!TIP]
> This is probably what you want if you know what devices your clients are using and want to ensure that only these devices are used.

## Passkeys / Client-side discoverable Credentials
A Client-side discoverable Credential Source is a public key credential source whose credential private key is stored in the authenticator,
client, or client device. Such client-side storage requires a resident credential-capable authenticator.
This is only supported by FIDO2 hardware, not older U2F hardware.

>[!NOTE]
> Passkeys is a technique that allows sharing credentials stored on the device with other devices. So from a technical standpoint of the server, there is no difference from client-side discoverable credentials. The difference is only that the phone or computer system automatically syncs the credentials between the user’s devices via a cloud service. The cross-device sync of passkeys is managed transparently by the OS.

### How does it work?
In a typical server-side key management process, a user initiates a request by entering their username and, in some cases, their password. 
The server validates the user's credentials and, upon successful authentication, retrieves a list of all public key identifiers associated with that user account. 
This list is then returned to the authenticator, which selects the first credential identifier it issued and responds with a signature that can be verified using the public key registered during the registration process.

In a client-side key process, the user does not need to provide a username or password.
Instead, the authenticator searches its own memory to see if it has saved a key for the relying party (domain).
If a key is found, the authentication process proceeds in the same way as it would if the server had sent a list
of identifiers. There is no difference in the verification process.

### How can I use it with this library?
#### On registration
When calling `WebAuthn\WebAuthn->getCreateArgs`, set `$requireResidentKey` to true
to notify the authenticator that it should save the registration in its memory.

#### On login
When calling `WebAuthn\WebAuthn->getGetArgs`, don't provide any `$credentialIds` (the authenticator will look up the IDs in its own memory and return the user ID as userHandle).
Set the type of authenticator to `hybrid` (Passkey scanned via QR Code) and `internal` (Passkey stored on the device itself).

#### Disadvantage
The RP ID (= domain) is saved on the authenticator. If an authenticator is lost, it is theoretically possible to find the services it was used against and login there.
